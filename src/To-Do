Goal: have a button that imports the names from a CSV file and displays them in a box
//when the button is pressed the user can choose which file to read from ✔️
// read the names from the file and add them to an array ✔️
//display the array visually in the panel
Improvement points:
- panel repainting too often means if user enlarges/minimises window the name labels are lost
- maybe have a box around the names so it's tidier?

Goal: make the names an object that can be dragged and dropped
//research if this can be done using jlabels or if another component is needed
